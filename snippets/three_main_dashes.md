# Three main dashes:

**Hyphen (-)**
- Shortest
- Used for: compound words, phone numbers
- Examples: "well-known", "555-1234", "co-worker"
- Keyboard: regular dash key

**En dash (–)**
- Medium length (width of letter "n")
- Used for: ranges, connections, scores
- Examples: "2020–2025", "pages 10–15", "New York–London flight", "Ravens–Steelers: 24–17"
- Keyboard: 
  - Mac: Option + -
  - Windows: Alt + 0150
  - Markdown: often --

**Em dash (—)**
- Longest (width of letter "m")
- Used for: breaks in thought, parenthetical statements, interruptions
- Examples: "The data—which was validated yesterday—shows patterns", "Three conditions—diabetes, COPD, and hypertension—were most common"
- Keyboard:
  - Mac: Option + Shift + -
  - Windows: Alt + 0151
  - Markdown: often ---

**Common usage for your work:**
- Codebook dates: "February 2025" (no dash needed, but if abbreviated: "Feb–Mar 2025" uses en dash)
- Email greetings: "Kevin-" (hyphen is fine, though some style guides prefer no punctuation)
- Value ranges: "0–3" or "days 21–100" (en dash)
- Explanatory asides: "The OTCC algorithm—specifically the denominator logic—needs review" (em dash)

**Practical tip:** In most technical writing, hyphen for compounds, en dash for ranges, em dash for emphasis/breaks.
